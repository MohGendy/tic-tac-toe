# TicTacToe Game
## Overview
This project is an advanced implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game developed in C++ with a focus on modular architecture, user interaction, and personalized gameplay experiences. It features both the standard 3√ó3 Tic Tac Toe and an extended Mega Tic Tac Toe mode for enhanced complexity and fun.
The game includes a modern graphical user interface built using Qt, along with SQLite integration for persistent user profiles and game history. It supports secure user authentication using bcrypt password hashing, and offers two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI (with difficulty levels implemented using the Minimax algorithm).
To ensure software quality, the project incorporates unit testing with Google Test, follows a clean C++ class structure, and uses GitHub Actions for CI (continuous integration). The codebase is organized for maintainability and extensibility, making it suitable for learning or further development.
## Objectives
- **Engaging Gameplay :** Provide a user-friendly and visually appealing experience through a responsive Qt GUI.

- **Multiple Game Modes :** Support both standard and Mega Tic Tac Toe boards with Player vs Player and Player vs AI modes.

- **Expanded Game Modes :** Support both the classic 3√ó3 grid and an extended Mega Tic Tac Toe mode to increase challenge.

- **Replay System :** Allow users to review past games through a built-in replay feature.

- **User Profiles :** Enable user authentication with secure password handling using bcrypt.

- **Game History :** Store complete game sessions in a persistent SQLite database.

- **Testing and CI :** Use Google Test for reliable unit testing and GitHub Actions for automated CI.

- **Clean Architecture :** Use object-oriented design and modular C++ code for maintainability and scalability.

## Features
- **üéÆClassic 3√ó3 Tic Tac Toe :** The standard version of the game.

- **üß©Mega Tic Tac Toe Mode :** An extended version for more strategic and complex gameplay.

- **ü§ùMultiplayer Support :** Play in Player vs Player or challenge the AI.

- **üß†AI Opponent with Difficulty Levels :** Implemented using the Minimax algorithm, offering Easy, Normal, and Hard levels.

- **üîêSecure User Authentication :** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for safe login and registration.

- **üïπÔ∏èGame History Tracking :** Stores all past matches in a SQLite database, including the outcome, players, and timestamp.

- **üíæMove-Level Storage :** Every move is recorded in a separate table to enable game replay functionality.

- **üîÅReplay System :** Players can replay previously played games step-by-step, reviewing all moves.

- **üñºÔ∏èGraphical User Interface (GUI) :** Built with Qt, offering a clean and interactive interface.

- **üß™Unit Testing :** Key components are tested using Google Test.

- **üîÅContinuous Integration (CI) :** Uses GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing on every commit.
